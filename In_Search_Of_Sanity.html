              The lack of light is somewhat clostrophobic but getting a chance to look around the room more clearly you see, in addition to the three cells from whence you emerged, a sturdy wooden door to one side of you, streaks of sticky mostly dried gore trailing from under the crack. Nearby the door are several heavy looking large sacks, a few bloody streaks tarnish their exterior.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the opposite side is an alcove that appears to have completly caved in, stone rouble and dirt now spilling out over the area, in fact looking around you notice varying cracks along most of the walls.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class = "check">DC 12 Arcitecture :</span> it looks like the entire foundation was shaken, something shifted the structure, an earthquake perhaps.
            <br><span class= "check indent">Crit:</span> you are confident that the structure is currently sound, though you doubt its ability to stay that way if it was hit by whatever it was again.
            <br><span class= "check indent">Fail:</span>  looks like the walls are cracked, maybe just age, not sure if it is structurally important
            <br><span class= "check indent"> Fumble:</span> the structure looks sevearly comprimised, if you don't get out of here it could fall on you at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              it opens up like a T, a now empty desk, a few scattered scraps of rouble around it takes up most of the alcove on the right, the left appears to lead around a corner.

                "WAKE UP DAMN IT!" (Campre Linweigh)

                As you regain conciousness, grogily (Small ammounts of
                blood trickling from lips or eyes as is appropriate, the
                bitter taste of copper)

                Your senses coming back to you, one at a time, your nose
                making itself known first, the unmistakable smell of rotting
                flesh, the acrid and putrid stench of rotting meat and feces
                fill your nose. (DC 10 Perception: behind the smell of death
                you notice a more distant aroma of ash and burnt flesh
                otherwise overwhelmed by the pervasive stench of decomposition)

                Glancing around You find yourself in small room
                , a bit less than 10 by 15 feet, every with walls covered in cracking
                white paint, peeling to reveal the dull gray of what appears to be stone arcitecture,
                 the back of the room rounded making the room a half circle.

                In Front of you are what appear to be the thin but
                otherwise sturdy bars of a cell wall. Just beyond them you see an unkonwn man
                strapped to a stable, wide leather straps restrain the body of a man who appears
                to have once been quite muscular, however his body now trembles under a criss
                crossing network red lines that cover his entire body. His struggling limbs against
                the table provide sound to an otherwise unnearvingly quite room.

                Standing next to this table is the figure of a very thin woman in a doctors coat.
                She interupts your line of sight briefly as she slowly circles this man on the table,
                all the while stopping to closely examine the varies cuts a nd bruises that fill most
                of the surface of his body. She spins a blade in her hand
                (DC 10 Perception: it's only sharpened on one side, a bit thick for a dagger, it doesn't
                seem like a proper weapon)
                (DC 12 Perception: AH! you see its other half a table next to her and realize its one
                half of a broken pair of pruning shears)

                on a small table there next to both of them are a series of instruments , a gardening trowl, forks, long pieces of broken metal and glass, half a pruning shear, all of them  all of them slick with varying amounts of fresh blood.

                (DC 12 Medicine: there is some old dried blood on the items as well, and all of the mans wounds look too fresh to explain some of the caked on blood on those items)

                This grisly scene is illuminated by the dull light of an oil lamp suspending from the ceiling
                over their heads. The light occationally glinting off the doctors blade as she spins it
                in her hand.

                Then she rather carelessly reaches down and adds a new cut across the mans thigh,
                he lets out a tortured wail, not the high pitched and energy filled scream of the
                surprised or freshly injured but a loud and breathy attempt to express pain in the way of someone whos nerves have little surprise left for pain but none the less cannot contain the horror of the sensation.
